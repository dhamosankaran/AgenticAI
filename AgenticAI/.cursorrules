# Instructions

During your interaction with the user, if you find anything reusable in this project (e.g., version of a library, model name), especially about a fix to a mistake you made or a correction you received, you should take note in the `Lessons` section in the `.cursorrules` file so you will not make the same mistake again.

You should also use the `.cursorrules` file as a Scratchpad to organize your thoughts. Especially when you receive a new task, you should first review the content of the Scratchpad, clear old different task if necessary, first explain the task, and plan the steps you need to take to complete the task. You can use todo markers to indicate the progress, e.g.
[X] Task 1
[ ] Task 2

Also update the progress of the task in the Scratchpad when you finish a subtask.
Especially when you finished a milestone, it will help to improve your depth of task accomplishment to use the Scratchpad to reflect and plan.
The goal is to help you maintain a big picture as well as the progress of the task. Always refer to the Scratchpad when you plan the next step.

├── src/
│   ├── api/             # FastAPI endpoints
│   ├── services/        # Business logic and services
│   └── utils/           # Utility functions

├── tests/               # Test suite
├── docs/                # Documentation
├── config/              # Configuration files
└── requirements.txt     # Project dependencies
```

2. **API Keys:**
* Store API keys in a `.env` file (use `.env.example` as a template)
* Use `python-dotenv`
* Example `.env.example`:
```
ALPHA_VANTAGE_API_KEY=
```
**DONT COMMIT THE .ENV FILE TO GIT**

3. **Financial Data Integration:**
* Use Alpha Vantage for market data
* Implement proper caching for API calls
* Handle rate limits and API errors gracefully

4. **Risk Assessment:**
* Implement basic risk scoring
* Consider age, income, goals
* Provide clear risk tolerance categories
* Document risk assessment methodology

5. **Investment Recommendations:**
* Base recommendations on user profile and market conditions
* Provide clear explanations for recommendations
* Include basic asset allocation

6. **Error Handling:**
* Implement basic error handling
* Provide informative error messages
* Handle API and data processing errors
* Log errors appropriately

7. **Testing:**
* Write unit tests for all components
* Test edge cases and error conditions
* Mock external API calls in tests
* Maintain basic test coverage

# Tools

* **Backend**: Python, FastAPI, Pydantic, pandas
* **Data Sources**: Alpha Vantage API
* **Testing**: pytest, pytest-asyncio, httpx
* **Documentation**: Markdown, Swagger/OpenAPI

>>>>>>> feature/dynamic-portfolio-allocation
# Lessons

* **API Keys**: Always use environment variables for API keys. Never commit API keys.
* **Virtual Environment**: Always activate the virtual environment before running commands.
* **Financial Data**: Cache API responses to avoid rate limits and improve performance.
* **Error Handling**: Implement basic error handling for all API calls and data processing.
* **Testing**: Write basic tests, especially for financial calculations.
* **Documentation**: Keep documentation up-to-date with code changes.
* **Data Validation**: Validate all user inputs and API responses.
* **Rate Limiting**: Implement basic rate limiting for external API calls.
* **Caching**: Use basic caching for market data.
* **Security**: Follow basic security practices.
* **Logging**: Implement basic logging for debugging.
* **Performance**: Optimize basic performance.
* **Maintainability**: Follow clean code principles.
<<<<<<< HEAD
* **GIT SECURITY CRITICAL**: When API keys are accidentally committed to git history, use git filter-branch or create clean orphan branches and force push to completely remove sensitive data from GitHub. Always enhance .gitignore to prevent future exposures.
* **EMERGENCY API KEY PROCEDURES**: If API keys are exposed in git history: 1) Immediately revoke the exposed key, 2) Create new API key, 3) Use git filter-branch or orphan branch approach to completely rewrite git history, 4) Force push to replace remote history, 5) Clear local reflog and run aggressive garbage collection, 6) Enhance .gitignore with comprehensive exclusions.

# Scratchpad

Current Task: [X] Ensure Portfolio Allocation and Summary Dynamic Updates - COMPLETED ✅
Project Status: Enhancement Phase - Portfolio Data Synchronization SUCCESSFUL

## Current Task Breakdown
[X] Examine current portfolio allocation implementation
[X] Check user profile integration with portfolio data  
[X] Fix identified issues with dynamic updates
[X] Implement comprehensive report generation with synchronized data
[X] Update Portfolio Agent to support 8 asset classes
[X] Enhance API endpoints for dynamic allocation generation
[X] Update Dashboard component with better allocation parsing
[X] Add recommended allocations section to Portfolio component
[X] Implement refresh mechanisms for real-time updates
[X] Test portfolio agent with updated allocations
[X] Test complete end-to-end functionality - ✅ PASSED
[X] Verify dynamic allocation generation - ✅ VERIFIED

## Final Implementation Verification Results
✅ **8 Asset Classes Working**: stocks, bonds, cash, real_estate, commodities, cryptocurrency, etfs, reits
✅ **Dynamic Risk Profiles**: 
   - Conservative: 25% stocks, 45% bonds, 0% crypto
   - Moderate: 50% stocks, 25% bonds, 2% crypto  
   - Aggressive: 65% stocks, 15% bonds, 3% crypto
✅ **All Allocations Sum to 100%**: Verified across all risk profiles
✅ **Synchronized Report Generation**: Allocation data matches report text exactly
✅ **Profile-Based Dynamic Updates**: Real-time allocation changes based on risk tolerance

## Key Implementation Highlights
1. **CoordinatorAgent.generate_comprehensive_report()** - Successfully generates synchronized data
2. **Portfolio Agent** - Properly balanced 8-asset class allocations for all risk levels
3. **API Endpoints** - Dynamic allocation generation working correctly
4. **Frontend Components** - Enhanced Dashboard and Portfolio components with refresh mechanisms
5. **End-to-End Integration** - Profile changes trigger dynamic allocation updates
